Genghis Khan achived great success for the Mongol empire, that impacted the modern world in ways we have forgotten. We judge Genghis Khan as a cruel and monstrous man, but we need to understand that those were other times, life was very different, and history has told us a different history of what really happened. With this in mind this are some of what I consider great lessons from Genghis Khan.

## Doing Things For The Right Purpose
From the kidnapping of his first wife, Genghis Khan was protecting his family and assuring its prosperity, this never change even when his family was the entire Mongol empire. This purpose was what lead to a life of warfare and success for the Mongols, it never was about personal power or pride. For example soilder purpose was not to die for the empire, instead their purpose was to achive prosperity for the Mongols this lead them to take the right actions in battle. 

## The Right People In The Right Place
In those times it was common that royal families had the top positions in the empire, but Genghis Khan did things differently. He put the best people in the best positions, no matter their background or social status. With this he understood the power of kwnoledge to drive progress and created great loyalty and opportunity for people.

## Radical Change
A lot of the great things that Genghis Khan achived, meant radical change at the time and lots of people did not share this vision. To make changes for the better you need to see things differently as other people, to wonder. And to make it real, most of the times means disruptive action in the ordinary way of the world.
