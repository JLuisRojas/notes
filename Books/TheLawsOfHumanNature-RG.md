## Grandiosity

We have a natural tendency to think highly of ourselves, to believe that we are some how gifted, especial with great ability. When we expirence some kindo of success we don't see with clarity the reasons of it. This can be dangeorus if we are naturally gifted.

We need to be able to:

* Recognize this in other people
* Recognize this in ourselves.

This grandisoity gives us confidence and momentum, which is a good thing when we realise it, and embrace it. The following needs to be achived:

1. Focus deeply on a project.
2. Mantain a dialogue with reality (feedback)
3. let your imagination flow.

**This steps are repated. 1 and 3 need to be done with balance, and 2 and 3 needs to be a constant dialogue.**

## Purpose

Animals have their instincts to follow, he as humans have to rely on our concious actions. Thus having a purpose to believe in is vital and we are naturally drawn to it.

To develop a high sense of purpose:

* **Discover your calling in life:** look at your earliest years and see what you are naturally drawn to.
* **Use resistance and negative spurs:** You want to embrace negative experiences, limitations and even pain as the perfect means fo building ip your skill levels and sharpening your sense of purpose.
* **Absorve purposeful energy:** we are suceptible to others moods and energy. So find and associate with people with high sense of purpose.
* **Lose yourself in the work:** to achive high level of purpose you need high commitment and sacrifices over a long period of time. You have to handle frustration, boredom and failure, so you need a lot of moments of flow.

### False purposes:

We need to know to recognize false purposes in ourselves and in others.

* Money and succes
* Attention
* Cynicism

## The Pull of the Group

We behave very differently when we are on a group and when we are alone, we think differently. This can be dangerous when we are not aware of it.

### Reality Group

What creates a functional, healthy dynamic is the ability to mantain a tight relationship to reality. It puts primary emphasis to the work it self, it brings the best out of human nature.

To achive this:

* Instill a collective sense of purpose
* Assemble the right team
* Let information and ideas flows freely (open mindness, transparency. Similar a cosas de Ray Dalio en Principles)
* Infect the group with productive emotions.
* See how people work under stress to create a great team.
