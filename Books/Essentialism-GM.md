Having to much access to data and being so conected isnt natural, and our brains arent wired to it. This creates an ilusion, that we can do and have a lot of things at the same time, but this is unachivable, life is simplier. Fullfilment in life comes from doing some essential things that bring greatness.

So we need to understand that only few things matter, for this is also important to realize:

	* If you dont prioritize, someone else wll.

## Explore

Understand that we have a choise, and this ability is what makes us human.

An Essentialist thinks almost everything is non essential, and the few essential things are the ones that produce more results. As Jhon Maxwell has written, "You cannot overstimate the unimportance of practically everything".

Understand that to achive great results, you need to make trade-offs. An essentialist thinks in this terms, asks "What is the trade-off I want to make?". As economist Thomas Sowell wrote: "There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs"

Essentialist take more time to explore ideas, this to make sure they focus on what matters. For this is important to take time to just think.

	* In order to have focus we need to scape focus


Listen to understand, ask questions and put attention on what is not being said. This to find the escense in information. **Have a Journal**.

When we play we are engaged in the purest expression of our humanity. Play helps us to stop being estressed, which fogs us of what is essential. Play doesn't just help us to explore what is essential. It is essential in and of itself.

The most important asset you have is youself, it is important to realise this, and means that you need to take care of your self. This is why things like sleep and excersise are so important, beacuse:
	
	* Our highest priority is to protect our ability to prioritize.

**Hell yeah or hell no.** We need to be very selective on what we do, dont fall in the trap of wanting to do everything. Only do things if you really feel like.


## Eliminate

Once you know what is essential, you need to eliminate everything else, this is tricky.

**Clarify**: when there is a lack of clarity, people waste time and energy on the trival many. This is why you need to have an Essential Intent that is:
	
	* Inspirational
	* Concrete

For this ask the following questions:

	* If we could be truly excellent at one thing, what would it be?
	* How will we know we are done?


**Dare**: saying no is hard and requires courage, and especially when is a good oportunity or someone asks you. But you need tume to think things through and focus on what matters.

**Editor**: earlier we mentioned that you need to question things be like a journalist, ask questions. But you also think like an editor that cuts the non-essential and keeps the most important activities.


## Action

Once you explored and identified the essential and eliminated the non-essential, you need to take action and make sure that this process is as effortless as possible.

**Buffer:** have a buffer so you dont feel overwhelmed with all the activites to do, take action with time.

**Substract Your Obstacles.**

**Progress:** create momentum with small wins.

**Flow:** have a routine to make this effortless.

**Focus:** Aks yourself deeply, what is important now?

**Be:** live the essential life.
