This is a great book that I wish I read earlier in my life so I be more interested in science and understanding the world many times we end up hating this topics thanks to school, mainly by the way the teach us this things.

There are many facts that I could point out and summarize, but I wont because I recommend you to read some chapters here and there, in order to get a glimpse to the amazing topics and stories that the book talk about.

This are some main observations after reading the book:
* We may feel that we live in an advanced civilization, but the reality is that we dont. Most of the breakthrougs of science had been in recent times if we compare it to the existance of humas, and there is still most of questions reamin unanswered.
* We know nothing about oceans.
* A lot of important scientist were strange people and very obsessed with their work.
