This occurs because in Goliath grandiosity, he expects David to behave in his advantage.

Sometimes Goliath can think that more is better, but a lot of things behave in a inverted U shape(google it to see how it looks). Where more is better up to some point but then its value decreases, this cam apply to money, classrooms size, etc. (Analize carefully)

	* Open to imagine things in different ways.
	* Take risks with action
	* Discipline to see things through
