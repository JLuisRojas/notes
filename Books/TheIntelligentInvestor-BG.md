Know the difference between investing and speculating.

Study the past and understand future policies, in order to make good decisions.

Almost all great fortune was accomplished by one great thing, for example big companys like Amazon, but as an investor is hard to find this one great thing when you dont have control over it. So to have stability and secure returns as an investor, do not put all your eggs in one baskest, diversify, but also do not expect crazy wealth overnight.

The financial system is complex and depends on a lot of variables, to make good decisions inside you need to understand it, and do not expect that what worked in the past will still works. So when making decisions be sure you have good principles in which this decisions are based. Here are some principles from Graham book:
* Know what you are doing–know your business: investment is most intelligent when is most businesslike.
* Do not let anyone else run your business, unless you understand and have confidence on the other person or institution.
* Do not enter upon an operation–calculation that is manufacturing or trading in an item–unless a reliable calculation shows that it has a faire chance to yield a reasonable profit. In particular, keep awa from vertures in which you have litle to gain and much to lose.
* Have the courage of your knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it–even though other may hesitate or differ.

Most great things are unconventional.
