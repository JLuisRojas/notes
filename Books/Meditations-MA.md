## Book II
### 4.
Remember how long you have been putting off these things, and how often you have received an opportunity from the gods, and yet do not use it. You must now at least perceive of what universe you are part, and from what administrator of the universe your existence flows, and that a limit of time is fixed for you, wich if you do not use for cleaning away the clouds form your mind, it will go and you will go, and it will never return.

## Book III

### 12.

If you aplly yourself to the task befores you, following right reason, seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you might be bound to give it back immediately; if you hold this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with your present activities according to nature, and with heoric truth in every word and sound which you utter, you will live happily. And there is no man who is able to prevent this

### 13.

As physicians have always ther instruments and knives ready for cases that suddenly require their skill, so do you have principles ready for the understanding of things divine and human, and for doing everything, even the smallest, with a recollection of the bond that unites the divine and human to each other. For neither can you do anything well that pertains to man without at the same time having a reference to things divine; nor the contrary.

## Book IV

### 2.

Let no act be done without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to the perfect principles of art.

### 17.

Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Deadth hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.

### 22.

Do not be whirled about, but in every moment have respect to justice, and on the occasion of every impression maintain the faculty of comprehension or understanding.

### 26.

Have you seen those things? Look also at these. Do not disturb yourself. Make yourself all simplicity. Does anyone do wrong? It is to himself that he does wrong. Has anything happened to you? Well, out of the universe from the beginning of everything that happens has been apportioned and spun out to you. In a word, your life is short. You must turn profit the present by the aid of reason and justice. Be sober in you relaxation.

### 36.

Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom yourself to consider that the nature of the universe loves nothing as much a to change the things that are and to make new things like them. For everthing that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be. But you are thinking only of seeds that are cast into the earth or into a womb: bu this is a very vulgar notion.

### 38.

Examine men's ruling principles, even those of the wise, what kind of things they avoid, and what kind they pursue.

### 47.

If any god told you that you will die tomorrow, or certainly on the day after tomorrow, you would not care much whether it was on the third day or on the morrow, unless you were in the highest degree mean-spirited–for how small is the difference? So think it no great thing to die after as many years as you can name rather than tomorrow.

## Book V

### 1.

In the morning, when you rise unwillingly, let this thought be present. I am rising to the work of a human being. Why then am i dissatisfied if I am going to do the things for which I exist and for which I was brought into the world? Or have i been made for this, to lie under the blankets and keep myself warm? But this is more pleasant. Do you exist then to take your pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Do you not see the little plats, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their separate parts of the universe? And are you unwilling to do the work of a human being, and do you not make haste to do what that which is according to your nature? But if necessary to take rest also. It is necessary: nature, however, has fixed bounds to this, too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet you go beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in your acts it is not so, but you stop short of what you can do. So you do not love yourself, for if you did, you would lover your nature and her will. Bu those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food; but you value your own nature less than the engraver values the egraving art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the lover of money value his money, or the vainglorious man his little glory. And to eat nor to sleep rather than to perfect the things that they care for. But are the acts that concern society mor vile in your eyes and less worthy of your labor?

### 8.

… And so accept everything that happens, even if it seems disagreeable, because it leads to this, to the health of the universe and the prosperity and felicity of Zeus (the universe). For he would not have brought on any man what he has brought if it were not useful for the whole...

### 31.

How have you behaved hitherto to the gods, your parents, brethren, children, teachers, to those who looked after your infancy, to your friends, kinfolks, to your slaves? Consider if you have hitherto behaved to all in such a way that this way be said of you:

> Never has he wronged a man in deed or word

And call to recollection both how many things you have passed through, and how many things you have been able to endure: and that the history of your life is now complete and your service is ended: and how many beautiful things you have seen: and how many pleasures and pains you have despised; and how many things called honorable you have spurned; and to how many many ill-minded folks you have shown a kind disposition.

## Book VI

### 2.

Let it make no difference to you whether you are cold or warm, if you are doing your duty; and whether you are drowsy or satisfied with sleep; and whether ill-spoken of or praised; and whether dying or doing something else. For it is one of the acts of life, this act by which we die: it is sufficient the in this act also to do well what we have in hand.

### 7.

Take pleasure in one thing and rest in it: in passing from one social act to another social act, thinking of God.
