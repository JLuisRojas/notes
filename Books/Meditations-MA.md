## Book II
### 4.
Remember how long you have been putting off these things, and how often you have received an opportunity from the gods, and yet do not use it. You must now at least perceive of what universe you are part, and from what administrator of the universe your existence flows, and that a limit of time is fixed for you, wich if you do not use for cleaning away the clouds form your mind, it will go and you will go, and it will never return.
