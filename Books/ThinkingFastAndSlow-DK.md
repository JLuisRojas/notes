> Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovergein masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do â€“ Jeremy Bentham <br>

* The reliance on the heuristic caused predictable biases (systematic errors) in their prediction.

* Our thinking consists of two systems 1 and 2, unconcious and concious respectivly. Our nature is optimized for good results with the least effort possible, when we can not retrive good answers fast then sytem 2 enters.

* Some tasks require more effort than others. The more effort one task requires, more focus we need on it which blind us to see other things. Switching focus frome one thing to another requires effort.

* Engaging on activities that require more of system 2 require energy that is limited, and the less energy we have the more influence system 1 has. This can lead to fall instant gratification tasks.

* Our minds are associatives machines and it can be unconcious, an image trigers a memory, which trigers emotions that our body reacts to it. This occurs with out noticing it (Priming), and can affect our decisions. It can be as simple as a sentence or an image in a wall.

* When we feel happy or at ease, system 1 has more influence in our decisions. And when we are tense sytem 2 is more active. And this affects in thow ways:
	* How we percieve things
	* familiar things

* The main functions of system 1 is to mantain and update a model of your personal world. Meaning that our brains have maps of norms and causes. And if note, creates one so the next event does not seam as surprising.

* It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, no its completness. Indeed you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern.

* System 1 tries to jump to conclusions so that lazy sistem 2 do not work. Meaning that it will try to form conclusions with the least information possible, this influences us way too much with first impressions and the evidence we have.

* System 1 is good with averages, but bad with sums.

* We rarely feel that we do not have a good answer to the questions we have. This is because when faced with a hard question system 1 simplifies it, so that lazy system 2 do not work. This simplification is called heuristics and the are helpful but deceiving. **Heuristics substitues one question for another.**

* System 1 tends to assume that what it is seeing and the conclusions it makes are true.

* When calculating the probability of an event:
	* Base rates matter
	* Do not exagerate the evidence

* "Subjects unwillingness to deduce the particular form the general was matched only by their willingness to infer the general from the particular". We learn more not by hearing statistics of the general, rather individual cases are better for teaching and making an impact, and then deducing the general.

* When the causes of an event are correlated with more than one factor, regression to the mean will occur. This means that if an above the average event occurs the next is most probably going to be below the average. On example of this is in performance of sport players.

* Statistical algorithms greatly outdo humans in noisy enviroments fo two reasons: the are more likely than humans judges to detect weakly valid cues and muc more likely to mantain a modest level of accuracy by using such cues consistently.

* Wheather professionals have a chance to delvelop intiutive expertise depends essentially on the quality and speed of feedback, as well on sufficient opportunity to practice.

* Be careful when trusting experts intiutions, they are only valid when enviroments are consistent and predictable. System 1 holds an oversimplified model of the worl so that it explains the past and can predict the future, but this is no how the world works, creating the ilusion of knowledge. The truth is that some things work under complex systems that correspond to a lot of factors, so it is imposible for us to predict with accuracy.

* As humans we are bad at making accurate assesments for projects, this is called planning fallacy. Neglecting the statistics of similar cases is perphaps the major source of error in forecasting.

* As planning expert Bert Flybjerg says: "This may be the single most important peace of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forcasting through impreoved methods. Using such distributional information from other ventures similar to that being forecasted is called taking an 'outside view' and is the cure to the planing fallacy". The steps to follow:
	1. Identify appropiate reference class
	2. Use the statistics to generate a baseline prediction.
	3. Use specific information about the case to adjust the baseline prediction.
