Tags: #self-help

* [Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVODGo4iqys) Talks about the importance of letting go, at the end there is something that always goes wrong and how you handle that situation, will set you apart from the others.

* Stay calm when you are problem solving, beacuse is the only way you are going to find a solution especially when things go wrong, beacause the always do. The only thing we could guarantee is that there will be some kind of conflict, so when you realize that thats for sure gonna happen you can relax a bit, because when it happens you are not surpried.

* We try to control everything and eventually you will get to the point where you can't hold on, the only thing you can do to actually control that situation is (ironical enough), **to let go before you lose control**. **Let go the things you can't control, the only thing that is guaranteed is chaos**.
