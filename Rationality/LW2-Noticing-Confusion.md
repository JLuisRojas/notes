For an event to be *evidence about* a target of inquiry, it has to happen *differently* in a way that’s entangled with the *different* possible states of the target.

If your eyes and brain work correctly, your beliefs will end up entangled with the facts. *Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.*

So try to explain why the kind of thought processes you use systematically produce beliefs that mirror reality. Explain why you think you’re rational. Why you think that, using thought processes like the ones you use, minds will end up believing “snow is white” if and only if snow is white. If you *don’t* believe that the outputs of your thought processes are entangled with reality, why believe the outputs of your thought processes? It’s the same thing, or it should be.
