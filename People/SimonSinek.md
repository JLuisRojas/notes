In games there exists two types of games finite and infinite, in finite games you play to win but in infinite games you play to get better because everything is unknow and the only competitior is yourself and how you limit yourself. 

The thing is that most of life is an infinte game, and when finite players play against infinite players the will burnout themselves and their resources.

To become a leader in the infinte game:

1. **A just cause:** is a purpose or cause so just that you willingly sacrifice to be a part of it. They are a description of the future state so ideal that for all practical purposes we will never actually achieve that vision, but we will die trying, that is the point, thats what gives our lifes and work meaning.
2. **Trust in teams: ** Create an environment where people can be their best, trust and help others, be honest with their mistakes and flaws
3. **Worthy adversary:** The only competitor in a infinite game is yourself but a worthy rival that is very good in your industry, beacause they reveal our weaknesses so we go back and improve, our goal is not to beat them but to improve and be the best ourselves.
4. **Exsitencial flexibility:** In the infinite the players are the one that dissapears not the game, the capacity for existencial flexibility is quiet simple a dramatic shift in strategy beacause you find a better way to advance your cause. Doing something that it we know is the right thing to do.
5. **Courage to lead:** The infinite game and the past 4 points are very difficult, this is why you need courage to achive it. The courage to lead fundamentally means that you are willing to be open minded to consider that maybe the way you think the world works maybe wrong, and the way we have been building our businesses based on all the social conventions and what everybody tell us is the right thing to do maybe is wrong. And if everyboyd is doing it doesn't mean it's right.

If we are living with an finite game mindset, we are playing to win an another to lose, to make money, to compare our records with others. Or we can chose to live with a infinte game mindset, to become leaders that build great teams, courage to embrace our weaknesses, have a worthy ribal to learn from and improve, to make decisions to adavance our cause.

The infinte game is code for the idealist to operate in a world that tell us to be realistic, is a code for people who bealieve that an unrealizable vision that is worth devoting our lifes to advance is better than the short term goal.
