* From the start of Netflix, the vision was a company where you will love to work in, where every day you will be exicited to solve problems with the people you work with everyday, and a great pleace to be from. 
* From the start Reed and Patty made a commit to themsevles that they would try to create the best place possible.
* What makes us happier at work is accompleshing hard things, where you go "we didn't thing we could do that and we sure didn't think we could do it by that deadline, but we did it!". And this stories there is always a team, a we, a team effort.
* Values are a waste of time, you should instead write behaviors. If we say integrity we write this is how it looks like, this is how you act like when you have integrity, and this how it looks like if you don't and if you don't, you don't work here anymore (very straightforward).
* The only way we will win is to make our product so much better that you will get addicted to it and you never will want to give it out, and so the only metric that matter was our customer. So we had to constantly improve.
* **Methodology for knowing when to hire, when to fire, who to hire**: Imagine your team six months from now (six months because business moves very fast now), let's say that in six months you have an amazing team and write down what is going to be occurring then that it's not occuring now, and walk around your company and make a movie about it like if it was optimal, would there be more meatings? Or woud there be less?. What is occurring then that is not occuring now?, you want to think about those behaviors. Now drop down a level and go, what would people need to know how to do, what skills and expirence would take in order to accomplish that in SIX MONTHS and then and only then who is in your team now. You hire someone that knows how to solve the problem that your team has, so now you haven't write down a "job description" because job descriptions are dumb.
* It's your job if you are running an organization to fill and build the team that can win and serve the customer, you never wanna let the talent or lack of talent in your organization come between you and what success looks like.
* As a CEO is your job to ALWAYS be looking for talent.
* When looking for work, is not what you know or who you know, is who knows what you know.
* Every year ask: if you are still the right person?, what weaknesses are we going to have next year?
* A good CEO: 1) Is very smart, good rapid fire abilty to process information and really big harddirve you want to recall a lot of information. 2) Be able to see the feature in way's that other people can't. 3) Be brave, you need to be the first to jump down from the cliff, you can't spin it you have to believe it.
* If your organization is successful things will change, so you want a team ready and looking for change.
